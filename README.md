# CV Project

## Image super resolution

This project is the implementation of the paper titled `Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks` by Chao Dong et al. The implementation is done in `Python3` and the library used for Learning is `Pytorch`. Apart from implementation, we have done may experiments on the hyper-parameters such as scale, blur radius, number of layers, number of kernels per layer etc.  

This project also includes the implementation of `Image super-resolution via sparse representation` by Yang J. et al. which is a non deep-learning approach for Image super-resolution.
The project also compares our SRCNN and Sparse Coding implementaion results with several other Classical Methods as well as Bayesian Model results.
